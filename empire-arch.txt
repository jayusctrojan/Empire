Privacy & Security Architecture
Complete Data Sovereignty:

Mac Studio Security:
- FileVault encryption (always on)
- Private LLM server (no external API calls)
- Local inference only
- API key vault for remaining cloud services
- Tailscale VPN for remote access
- No data leaves network unless explicitly backed up

Cloud Security (minimal surface):
- TLS encryption in transit
- AES-256 encryption at rest
- Minimal API usage (mostly storage/orchestration)
- Private VPC networks where available
- SOC 2 compliant vendors only

Backup Encryption:
- Client-side encryption before upload
- Zero-knowledge backup to B2
- Encrypted configuration in private Git
AI Model Distribution
Mac Studio Models (Local)

	•	Qwen2.5-VL-7B (5GB) - Vision analysis
	•	mem-agent (3GB) - Always-on memory
	•	nomic-embed-text (2GB) - Local embeddings
	•	Future: Can add 2-3 more 7B models if needed
Cloud Models (Rarely Used)

	•	Previous $50/month → Now $5-10/month
	•	98% of inference now local
Workflow Integration
Unified Workflow Examples:

Financial Document Processing:
1. Upload to n8n endpoint
2. Route to Mac Studio for processing
3. Llama 70B analyzes with mem-agent context
4. Automatic encrypted backup to B2
5. Zero external API calls for privacy

Course Material Processing:
1. Upload triggers n8n workflow
2. MarkItDown converts to Markdown locally
3. Mac Studio generates embeddings
4. Store vectors in Pinecone
5. Cache frequently used on Mac Studio

Complex Query:
1. Query via Open WebUI interface
2. mem-agent retrieves context (<500ms)
3. Llama 70B processes locally (32 tok/s)
4. Pinecone provides additional knowledge
5. Response in 1-3 seconds total

Vision Analysis:
1. Image/video frame input
2. Qwen-VL processes on Mac Studio
3. Results integrated with text analysis
4. No external vision API needed
