# START HERE

Welcome to the n8n Orchestration Documentation - Split Edition!

This directory contains the complete 10,231-line orchestration guide split into 18 organized, navigable files.

## What's In Here?

You have everything you need to understand, implement, and deploy a complete n8n-based document processing and RAG system with:
- Document intake and processing
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Multi-turn chat with memory
- LightRAG and CrewAI integration
- Production deployment configurations

## First Steps

### If you're completely new:
1. **Read this first:** `README.md` (Quick overview)
2. **Then read:** `00_overview.md` (Architecture and philosophy)
3. **Finally:** Pick a topic from `QUICK_LOOKUP.md`

### If you're implementing:
1. **Start:** `milestone_1_document_intake.md`
2. **Continue:** Follow milestones 2-7 in order
3. **Reference:** `database_setup.md` and `node_patterns.md`
4. **Deploy:** `deployment_configuration.md`

### If you're looking for something specific:
1. **Use:** `QUICK_LOOKUP.md` to find content by topic
2. **Or:** `INDEX.md` for a complete file index

## The 18 Files Explained

### Navigation (Read First)
- `README.md` - Quick start guide
- `INDEX.md` - Master index with cross-references
- `QUICK_LOOKUP.md` - Find content by topic
- `SPLIT_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed completion report

### Core Documentation
- `00_overview.md` - Architecture, V7.2 features, philosophy

### Implementation (Follow in Order)
- `milestone_1_document_intake.md` - Upload, validate, store
- `milestone_2_universal_processing.md` - Extract, chunk text
- `milestone_3_advanced_rag.md` - Generate embeddings
- `milestone_4_query_processing.md` - Hybrid search, RAG
- `milestone_5_chat_ui.md` - Chat interface, memory
- `milestone_6_monitoring.md` - System monitoring
- `milestone_7_admin_tools.md` - Administration

### Technical Reference
- `database_setup.md` - 37+ SQL schemas (116KB!)
- `integration_services.md` - External services (160KB!)
- `node_patterns.md` - Implementation patterns
- `overview.md` - Additional overview content

### Deployment & Testing
- `deployment_configuration.md` - Docker, Render.com setup
- `testing_validation.md` - Complete testing procedures (124KB!)

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Original file size | 360 KB |
| Original lines | 10,231 |
| Total files created | 18 |
| Total SQL schemas | 37+ |
| Complete workflows | 7 (all milestones) |
| Content preserved | 100% |

## What You'll Learn

### Document Processing
- File upload and validation
- Hash-based deduplication
- Support for PDF, Word, Excel, images, audio, video
- Tabular data extraction
- Metadata management

### Search & Retrieval
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Vector embeddings with pgvector
- Knowledge graphs
- Context expansion
- Natural language to SQL translation

### Conversation
- Multi-turn chat
- User memory graphs
- Chat history
- Integration with LightRAG

### Operations
- System monitoring
- Admin tools
- Deployment
- Testing & validation

## Technology Stack

- **n8n** - Workflow orchestration
- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL + pgvector
- **Redis** - Caching
- **LightRAG** - Knowledge extraction
- **CrewAI** - Multi-agent system
- **Docker** - Containerization

## How to Navigate

### By Role

**Developer** → Start with `00_overview.md`, follow milestones 1-7
**DevOps** → See `deployment_configuration.md` and testing guide
**Database Admin** → Reference `database_setup.md`
**System Integrator** → Check `integration_services.md`

### By Topic

**Upload documents** → `milestone_1_document_intake.md`
**Search documents** → `milestone_4_query_processing.md`
**Chat with documents** → `milestone_5_chat_ui.md`
**Deploy system** → `deployment_configuration.md`
**Test everything** → `testing_validation.md`

### By Question

"How do I...?" → Look in `QUICK_LOOKUP.md`

## Important Notes

- **All JSON is ready to import** into n8n
- **All SQL is production-ready** for Supabase
- **No content is lost** - this is a complete split
- **Files are organized logically** - not by size
- **Cross-references throughout** - easy navigation

## Next: What to Read

Choose based on your situation:

**Option 1 (Recommended for most):**
1. This file (you're reading it!)
2. `README.md` (5 min read)
3. `00_overview.md` (15 min read)
4. `milestone_1_document_intake.md` (implementation)

**Option 2 (Quick overview):**
1. `README.md`
2. `QUICK_LOOKUP.md` (find what you need)

**Option 3 (Deployment focused):**
1. `deployment_configuration.md`
2. `testing_validation.md`

**Option 4 (Reference focused):**
1. `database_setup.md`
2. `integration_services.md`
3. `node_patterns.md`

## Good Luck!

You now have the complete blueprint for a professional n8n-based document processing and RAG system. 

Start with the option that matches your situation above, and refer back to `QUICK_LOOKUP.md` whenever you need to find something specific.

All the code is ready to use. Let's build something great!
