		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Backend Environment Setup (FastAPI, Celery, Supabase, Redis, Neo4j)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the backend environment setup into subtasks for provisioning each service (FastAPI, Celery, Supabase PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis, Neo4j), configuring secure communication (TLS 1.3), and validating integration and connectivity.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves provisioning and configuring multiple production-grade backend services, each with its own deployment and security requirements. Ensuring secure communication (TLS 1.3), encrypted environment variables, and integration between services (e.g., Celery with Redis, FastAPI with Supabase and Neo4j) adds significant complexity. Testing requires integration and health checks across all components. Industry best practices recommend modularizing such setups for maintainability and reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Celery Task Queue Management",
			"complexityScore": 6.5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose Celery task queue management into subtasks for priority queue configuration, status tracking integration, retry logic implementation, dead letter queue setup, and end-to-end testing.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a robust, priority-based Celery task queue with retries and dead letter handling requires careful configuration of both Celery and Redis, as well as integration with Supabase for status tracking. Testing must cover various failure and retry scenarios. While Celery provides much of the needed functionality, orchestrating these features and ensuring reliability in production increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Vector Storage & Indexing (Supabase pgvector)",
			"complexityScore": 7.5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand vector storage and indexing into subtasks for enabling pgvector, creating HNSW index, optimizing batch inserts, organizing by namespace, and implementing metadata filtering.",
			"reasoning": "Storing and indexing high-dimensional embeddings at scale with pgvector and HNSW requires careful database configuration, performance tuning, and bulk operation optimization. Supporting metadata filtering and namespace organization adds to schema and query complexity. Testing must ensure both correctness and performance under load, following best practices for vector search systems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 39,
			"taskTitle": "CrewAI Inter-Agent Messaging & Collaboration",
			"complexityScore": 8.5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down inter-agent messaging and collaboration into subtasks for designing the interaction schema, implementing direct/broadcast messaging, event publication, state synchronization, conflict resolution, and workflow simulation testing.",
			"reasoning": "Enabling robust inter-agent communication, delegation, and collaboration in a multi-agent system is inherently complex. It requires designing flexible schemas, handling asynchronous messaging, ensuring state consistency, and supporting both direct and broadcast communication. Conflict resolution and workflow simulation add further technical and testing challenges, especially in distributed or concurrent environments."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Backblaze B2 Folder Management & Encryption",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide B2 folder management and encryption into subtasks for implementing folder movement logic, integrating b2sdk, supporting AES encryption with PyCryptodome, handling status-based transitions, and verifying organization/encryption through tests.",
			"reasoning": "Automating file movement across cloud storage folders based on processing status, while supporting optional zero-knowledge encryption, involves both API integration and secure cryptographic handling. Ensuring atomicity of moves, correct encryption/decryption, and robust error handling increases the technical challenge. Testing must cover all transition and encryption scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 38,
			"taskTitle": "CrewAI Multi-Agent Orchestration Agents Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand orchestration agent implementation into subtasks for agent/crew configuration, sequential/parallel execution logic, CrewAI API integration, workflow management, output validation, and orchestration testing.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing orchestration agents for complex, multi-document workflows requires advanced coordination logic, support for both sequential and parallel execution, and deep integration with the CrewAI API. Managing agent lifecycles, dependencies, and ensuring correct execution order and output quality are non-trivial, especially as workflows scale in complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 37,
			"taskTitle": "CrewAI Document Analysis Agents Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down document analysis agent implementation into subtasks for agent configuration, CrewAI API integration, workflow execution, output storage in Supabase/B2, and accuracy testing.",
			"reasoning": "Configuring and integrating multiple specialized analysis agents with CrewAI, ensuring structured output, and storing results across systems requires careful design and testing. While the CrewAI API abstracts some complexity, orchestrating workflows and validating fact-checking accuracy adds to the implementation effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 41,
			"taskTitle": "Security Hardening & Compliance",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose security hardening and compliance into subtasks for JWT authentication, RBAC enforcement, encrypted storage setup, input validation, audit trail implementation, compliance feature integration (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2), and security/compliance testing.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing comprehensive security and compliance features across authentication, authorization, encryption, input validation, and audit logging is highly complex. Each compliance standard (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) introduces specific requirements and documentation. Security testing and penetration testing are essential and time-consuming, making this one of the most challenging tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Chat UI Implementation (WebSocket, Streaming)",
			"complexityScore": 6.5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand chat UI implementation into subtasks for frontend development (Gradio/Streamlit), WebSocket endpoint implementation, streaming response handling, typing indicator/error handling, and mobile responsiveness testing.",
			"reasoning": "Building a real-time, streaming chat UI with WebSocket support and mobile responsiveness involves both frontend and backend development. Handling token-by-token streaming, error states, and responsive design adds moderate complexity, but established frameworks and patterns help mitigate risk."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 34,
			"taskTitle": "Analytics Dashboard Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down analytics dashboard implementation into subtasks for dashboard UI development (Grafana/Streamlit), metrics aggregation from Supabase/Prometheus, data visualization, and load/responsiveness testing.",
			"reasoning": "Building an analytics dashboard using established tools like Grafana or Streamlit is relatively straightforward, but requires careful metrics aggregation, data modeling, and visualization design. Ensuring dashboard responsiveness under load and accurate metric representation adds some complexity, but industry-standard tools reduce risk."
