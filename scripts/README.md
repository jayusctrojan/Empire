**Total:** 66 folders

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/setup_b2_production_structure.py
```

**Output:**
```
✅ B2 Production Structure Setup Complete!
📊 Created: 66 folders
```

## Workflow Overview

### 1. CrewAI Generates Suggestions

When CrewAI analyzes course content, it creates suggestions:

```
processed/crewai-suggestions/{asset-type}/drafts/
```

### 2. Review and Approve

You review and test the suggestions, then move to approved:

```bash
# Manual move (or via UI in future)
mv processed/crewai-suggestions/claude-skills/drafts/my-skill.yaml \
   processed/crewai-suggestions/claude-skills/approved/my-skill.yaml
```

### 3. Promote to Production

Run the promotion script:

```bash
python3 scripts/promote_to_production.py
```

Assets are copied to:
```
production/{department}/{asset-type}/
```

### 4. Production Use

Your workflows and systems read from production folders:

**n8n workflows:**
```javascript
const skills = await b2.listFiles('production/sales-marketing/claude-skills/');
```

**Claude Code:**
```json
{
  "skills": {
    "source": "b2://JB-Course-KB/production/_global/claude-skills/"
  }
}
```

## Asset Types

| Asset Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **claude-skills** | YAML skill definitions | Automate tasks in Claude Code |
| **claude-commands** | Markdown slash commands | Quick actions via `/command` |
| **crewai-agents** | Agent configurations | Deploy specialized AI agents |
| **prompts** | AI prompt templates | Consistent AI interactions |
| **workflows** | n8n workflow JSONs | Automate pipelines |

## Departments

1. `it-engineering`
2. `sales-marketing`
3. `customer-support`
4. `operations-hr-supply`
5. `finance-accounting`
6. `project-management`
7. `real-estate`
8. `private-equity-ma`
9. `consulting`
10. `personal-continuing-ed`

## Versioning & Rollback

Every production update automatically creates a backup:

```
production/_versions/{department}/{filename}.{timestamp}.backup
```

**To rollback:**
```python
# Copy previous version back to production
cp production/_versions/sales-marketing/skill.20250102_143000.backup \
   production/sales-marketing/claude-skills/skill.yaml
```

## Requirements

```bash
pip install b2sdk python-dotenv
```

**Environment Variables (.env):**
```bash
B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID=your_key_id
B2_APPLICATION_KEY=your_key
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Source file not found"**
- Check that file exists in approved/ folder
- Verify filename spelling

**"Bucket not found"**
- Verify B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID and B2_APPLICATION_KEY in .env
- Check bucket name is "JB-Course-KB"

**"Permission denied"**
- Ensure B2 application key has write permissions
- Check folder exists (run setup script first)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Web UI for promotion workflow
- [ ] Automated testing before promotion
- [ ] Bulk promotion support
- [ ] Integration with Claude Code for direct loading
- [ ] Automated rollback on errors
- [ ] Approval workflow with notifications
