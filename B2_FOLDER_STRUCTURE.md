## CrewAI Suggestions & Production Structure

### CrewAI Suggestions Folder Structure

When CrewAI analyzes course content, it generates actionable suggestions stored in `processed/crewai-suggestions/`:

```
processed/crewai-suggestions/
│
├── claude-skills/                   # YAML skill definitions for Claude Code
│   ├── drafts/                     # Newly generated, needs review
│   └── approved/                   # Reviewed and ready for production
│
├── claude-commands/                 # Markdown slash commands
│   ├── drafts/
│   └── approved/
│
├── agents/                          # CrewAI agent definitions
│   ├── drafts/
│   └── approved/
│
├── prompts/                         # AI prompts and templates (NEW)
│   ├── drafts/
│   └── approved/
│
└── workflows/                       # n8n workflow definitions (NEW)
    ├── drafts/
    └── approved/
```

**Asset Types Explained:**

1. **`claude-skills/`** - YAML skill definitions that extend Claude Code capabilities
   - Example: `project-charter-generator.yaml`
   - Used for: Automating common tasks in Claude Code

2. **`claude-commands/`** - Markdown slash commands for quick actions
   - Example: `review-pr.md`, `analyze-metrics.md`
   - Used for: Custom `/commands` in Claude Desktop

3. **`agents/`** - CrewAI agent configurations for multi-agent workflows
   - Example: `sales-agent-config.yaml`, `finance-analyst.yaml`
   - Used for: Deploying specialized AI agents per department

4. **`prompts/`** - AI prompt templates and engineering patterns (NEW)
   - Example: `sales-proposal-template.md`, `code-review-prompt.yaml`
   - Used for: Consistent, high-quality AI interactions

5. **`workflows/`** - n8n workflow JSON definitions (NEW)
   - Example: `document-intake-enhanced.json`, `course-analysis.json`
   - Used for: Automating document processing pipelines

### Production Folder Structure (Department-based)

Once suggestions are approved, they're promoted to `production/` for active use:

```
production/
│
├── _global/                         # Cross-department assets
│   ├── claude-skills/
│   ├── claude-commands/
│   ├── crewai-agents/
│   ├── prompts/
│   └── workflows/
│
├── _versions/                       # Rollback backups
│   └── [timestamped backups]
│
├── it-engineering/                  # Department-specific assets
│   ├── claude-skills/
│   ├── claude-commands/
│   ├── crewai-agents/

### Promotion Workflow

```mermaid
1. CrewAI analyzes course content
   ↓
2. Generates suggestions → `drafts/`
   ↓
3. You review and test → Move to `approved/`
   ↓
4. Ready for production? → Run promotion script
   ↓
5. Asset copied to `production/{department}/`
   ↓
6. n8n workflows and Claude Code read from production
   ↓
7. Old version backed up to `production/_versions/`
```

**Example: Promoting a Project Charter Skill**

```bash
# Step 1: CrewAI generates suggestion
processed/crewai-suggestions/claude-skills/drafts/project-charter-generator.yaml

# Step 2: You review and approve
mv drafts/project-charter-generator.yaml approved/project-charter-generator.yaml

# Step 3: Promote to production
python scripts/promote_to_production.py

# Interactive prompts:
#   Asset type: claude-skills
#   File: project-charter-generator.yaml
#   Destination: project-management (or _global)

# Step 4: Now in production!
production/project-management/claude-skills/project-charter-generator.yaml

# Your workflows can now use it:
# - Claude Code loads skills from production/
# - n8n reads from production/{dept}/ folders
```

### Production Asset Management

**Versioning:**
- Every production update creates a timestamped backup in `production/_versions/`
- Rollback: Copy previous version back from `_versions/`

**Global vs. Department-specific:**
- **`_global/`** - Assets used across all departments (e.g., "Meeting Summarizer")
- **`{department}/`** - Department-specific assets (e.g., "Sales Proposal Generator" in `sales-marketing/`)

**Scripts Available:**
1. **`scripts/setup_b2_production_structure.py`** - Creates all production folders
2. **`scripts/promote_to_production.py`** - Interactive promotion tool

### Integration with Workflows

**n8n Workflow Example:**

```javascript
// Load production skills for department
const department = "sales-marketing";
const assetType = "claude-skills";
const b2Path = `production/${department}/${assetType}/`;

// List all production skills
const skills = await b2.listFiles(b2Path);

// Load and execute skill
for (const skill of skills) {
  const skillContent = await b2.downloadFile(skill.fileName);
  // Use skill in your workflow
}
```

**Claude Code Integration:**

```yaml
# claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "skills": {
    "source": "b2://JB-Course-KB/production/_global/claude-skills/"
  }
}
```
