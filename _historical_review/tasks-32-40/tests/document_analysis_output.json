    "document": "\n    Title: California Insurance Policy Requirements - 2024\n\n    The State of California requires all vehicle owners to maintain minimum\n    liability insurance coverage. As of January 2024, the minimum coverage\n    limits are:\n    - $15,000 for injury/death to one person\n    - $30,000 for injury/death to more than one person\n    - $5,000 for damage to property\n\n    According to the California Department of Insurance (CDI), approximately\n    85% of California drivers maintain coverage above these minimums.\n    Insurance companies such as State Farm, Geico, and Progressive dominate\n    the market, with State Farm holding a 22% market share as of 2023.\n\n    The average annual premium for minimum coverage in California is $742,\n    though this varies significantly by region. Los Angeles County residents\n    pay an average of $892 annually, while rural counties like Modoc average\n    $521 per year.\n\n    Recent legislation (AB 1234) passed in 2023 aims to increase minimum\n    coverage requirements by 20% starting January 2025, citing inflation\n    and rising medical costs.\n    ",
