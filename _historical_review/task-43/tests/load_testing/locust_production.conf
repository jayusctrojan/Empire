# Locust Configuration - Production Heavy Load Profile
# Empire v7.3 Load Testing
# For testing against Render production deployment
# CAUTION: This will generate real load on production services

# Target host - Render production
host = https://jb-empire-api.onrender.com

# User simulation - 2x expected load for production stress test
users = 100
spawn-rate = 10

# Test duration (shorter for production to minimize cost)
run-time = 5m

# Output
headless = true
html = reports/load_test_production_report.html
csv = reports/load_test_production

# Logging
loglevel = INFO
logfile = reports/load_test_production.log

# Exclude very resource-intensive operations on production
exclude-tags = resource-intensive

# WARNING: Running heavy load tests on production can:
# - Incur significant API costs (Anthropic, Perplexity, etc.)
# - Impact real users
# - Trigger rate limits
# - Generate audit logs
# USE WITH CAUTION!
